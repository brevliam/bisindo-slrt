# Single-Stream & Two-Stream Network Implementation for BISINDO Recognition and Translation
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the end-to-end sign language translation network proposed by Yutong Chen Et al., in the paper: [A Simple Multi-Modality Transfer Learning Baseline for Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04287v2.pdf) and [Two-Stream Network for Sign Language Recognition and Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01367v2.pdf). The implementation is adopted from the official repository [TwoStreamSLT](https://github.com/FangyunWei/SLRT/tree/main/TwoStreamNetwork).
